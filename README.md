## Introduction

**nf-core/rnaseq** is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline used for RNA sequencing data.

The workflow processes raw data from
FastQ inputs ([FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/),
[Trim Galore!](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/)),
aligns the reads
([STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) or
[HiSAT2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/index.shtml)),
generates counts relative to genes
([featureCounts](http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/featureCounts/),
[StringTie](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/)) or transcripts
([Salmon](https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon/),
[tximport](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/tximport.html) or
[RSEM](https://github.com/deweylab/RSEM)) and performs extensive quality-control on the results
([RSeQC](http://rseqc.sourceforge.net/),
[Qualimap](http://qualimap.bioinfo.cipf.es/),
[dupRadar](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/dupRadar.html),
[Preseq](http://smithlabresearch.org/software/preseq/),
[edgeR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html),
[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info/)). See the [output documentation](docs/output.md) for more details of the results.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.

## Quick Start

i. Install [`nextflow`](https://nf-co.re/usage/installation)

ii. Install either [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) or [`Singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/) for full pipeline reproducibility (please only use [`Conda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) as a last resort; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#basic-configuration-profiles))

iii. Download the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -profile test,<docker/singularity/conda>
```

iv. Start running your own analysis!

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -profile <docker/singularity/conda> --reads '*_R{1,2}.fastq.gz' --genome GRCh37
```

See [usage docs](docs/usage.md) for all of the available options when running the pipeline.
